# A Set of CSS Styles for Improving Trello

## Overview
* adds label name to labels so you can tell what the label is at a glance
* adds custom label colors so you can expand beyond the default 10

## Dependencies
These adjustments use CSS styles so you'll need a browser plugin to run them. I've created these specifically for [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha), a Google Chrome Extension, but you can copy the CSS into your favorite CSS browser tool.

## Chrome Installation Instructions
* Install [Stylebot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha)
* Go to Stylebot options
* Select Backup
* Select Import Styles
* Copy and Paste the content of this JSON file into the window
* **WARNING!!** This will overwrite your current styles. If you already have some, you need to first select Export Styles, append these styles to that file, and then Import

## Safari Installation Instructions

1. Download <http://sobolev.us/stylish/>

3. Select `Manage` button
4. Choose `Edit` to make a new style
